<h1>Javascript Chess</h1>

<p>
In 2002 I (Douglas Bagnall) wrote a 
<a href="http://www.the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=719">javascript chess game</a>
for the 5k competition.  People are still curious about it,  so it has finally gained 
its own sourceforge site.  
</p>
<p>
The code is now in the public domain.  That means you can do whatever you want with it;  
there is no copyright.
</p>

<h2>Different Versions</h2>
<p>
The code has forked a few times already, due mainly to a lack of version control. 
I think this is an OK thing with such a tiny program, allowing experiments and
varying objectives.  If you want to take it in a new direction, please do.  It would
be nice if you put your fork in the CVS tree, but of course there is no obligation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/5k/">smallest possible page</a>.  Less than 3k of code should 
be possible.
</li>
<li><a href="/main-branch/">Better play, more readable code</a>, with debugging
stuff.  
</li>
<li><a href="/6k/">Something inbetween</a> - good but small.  
</li>
<li>Personal or experimental branches, such as Ron Winter's 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/p4wn/chess/misc/ron/">untangled 
version</a> and perhaps an actionscript branch. 
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
It recursively explores the tree of possible moves, keeping score along the way.  
It tries to take as many pieces as possible and get into the centre early.  That's
about all.   Its endgame strategy is to win before the endgame. 
</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>It doesn't always lose graciously, often trying to move out of checkmate.  You 
could take that as a concession, but it is irksome.</p>

<h2>To do</h2>

<p>(incomplete list)</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix the bug.</li>
<li>
The small ("5k") branch can be shrunk in a number of ways.  It uses
a principal variation search algorithm, which could be replaced by a smaller plainer 
alpha-beta search (I tried principal variation in search of speed, and never got
round to switching back).  Someone claims 
<a href="http://krishaven.spymac.net/javacomp.html">compression tricks</a> could save
744 bytes.  Better encoding of piece names will save space and time.
</li>
<li>
The big version could be reoptimised for speed rather than space.  Different searches and
evaluations could be tried (it really is naive now).  The recursion could be removed.  
Some kind of hackery could be used to get past the javascript timeout in browsers. 
Some of the variable names are a bit stupid.
</li>
<li>
The pictures could be better.
</li>
<li>
It could also, very easily, be ported to actionscript, and compiled for flash players.
The core engine is simple ECMAscript, so I can't see to much trouble with porting it. 
It may be possible to have two separate wrappers for the same engine, so developments
in javascript are usable in flash.
</li>
<li> 
One day it might get a name.
</li>
</ul>

Neil Pearce has written a javascript chess game which can be found at
<a
href="http://javascript.internet.com/games/javascript-chess-with-cpu-oppo.html">internet.com</a>
and other places.  
</p>
<p>
There was one by David Moore in the 
<a href="http://www.the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=352">2001 5k
competition</a>. Unfortunately it won't work in my
browsers.

<p>
The most famous small chess implentation is probably the <a
href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~uzdm0006/scans/1kchess/assem.html">1k
ZX81</a> game.  Not only is it very short, it ran in only 1024 bytes of ram.
On the other hand, it didn't know all the rules.

<h2>License (or lack thereof)</h2>
<p>
Most popular free licenses are longer than the code, and often refer to things that
don't apply well to a webpage (such as the source/binary distinction).  So it is public 
domain.
