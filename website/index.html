<h1>P4wn, a javascript chess engine</h1>


<p>
This is a small javascript chess engine. It was originally written by
Douglas Bagnall between 2000 and 2002, and a <a
href="http://p4wn.sourceforge.net/5k/">version</a> of it
was entered in the 2002 5k competition. Various people have added bits
and pieces over the years, and in 2012 it was substantially rewritten
to ease modification and embedding.
</p>
<p>
P4wn has been placed in the public domain with a CC-zero dedication. That
means you can do whatever you want with it without asking anyone.
</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2012-03-19: Switch to Git, with clarified code</h3>
<p>
All of a sudden I decided to pay some attention to this. The <a
href="http://p4wn.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=p4wn/p4wn;a=summary">git
repository</a> obsoletes the CVS, and the code has had some attention
to make it explicable.
</p>

<h3>2005-03-23: Sven Vahar's fancy version in CVS</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://aab.pri.ee/chess/">improved board</a> that
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/">Sven Vahar</a> made in December 2004 is now
available in CVS, and as a zip <a href="downloads/sven_vehars_fancy_version.zip">download</a>.
</p>

<h3>2005-03-04: Unicode version by Antony Lesuisse</h3>
<p>
Antony Lesuisse replaced the external gifs with unicode glyphs, creating a
<a href="unicode/">completely self-contained page</a> of only 4385 bytes.  It has been added to CVS.
</p>
<p>
If you don't see a row of chess pieces here (&#9812;&#9813;&#9814;&#9815;&#9821;&#9822;&#9823;),
you might have problems using the page - it depends on your browser's font rendering.
</p>
<h3>2004-12-14: New version by Sven Vahar</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/">Sven Vahar</a> has created a cleaner
interface with help text, with both
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/male/">Estonian</a> and
<a href="http://aab.pri.ee/chess/">English</a> versions.

</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
It recursively explores the tree of possible moves, keeping score along the way.
It tries to take as many pieces as possible and get into the centre early.  That's
about all.   Its endgame strategy is to win before the endgame.
</p>

<h2>Mailing list</h2> <p>There is a <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/p4wn-chess">mailing
list</a> hosted by sourceforge, which averages about two messages per
year. Ask any questions there.

It seems much stronger than p4wn, and uses the WebWorkers javascript
to keep the UI going while it schemes away in the background.

The most famous small chess implentation is probably the <a
href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~uzdm0006/scans/1kchess/assem.html">1k
ZX81</a> game.  Not only is it short, it ran in only 1024 bytes of ram
(javascript has megabytes to play with).
On the other hand, it didn't know all the rules.
