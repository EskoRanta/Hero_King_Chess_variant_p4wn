In Hero King Chess Variant, there is only one change in the rules of standard chess, namely that the pieces are replaced by Hero King -piece
who is still the royal piece and moves like the standard chess king, but has *frontal shielding*, which changes the game drastically.

The Hero King can't be threatened by any piece in a rank that is in forward position from the Hero King's rank (as defined by what is forward for his pawns).
That is, rooks and queens can check him from the same rank, or from back, knights and bishops only from behind, but pawns... never!
That makes the Hero King a fearsome frontline warrior totally unlike the wimpy standard chess king.

Have fun playing the variant! It will surely be confusing at first and the situations with forward positioned Hero Kings will look crazy, but you'll learn.
A hint: Capturing an enemy rook from its starting square by your Hero King is very tempting, but it will often lead to tragedy. ;)
